This repository serves as a reference for useful Arcade expressions. Many were created for a specific use case, but are easily adapted to new feature classes.
To begin fitting these expressions to new fields, feature classes, or datastores, variables can be assigned to different objects or values.
In theory, variable names can be kept but should be changed to reflect new meanings as is best practice.
